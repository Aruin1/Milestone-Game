Description

_(I wish to make a game requiring players to make choices based on limited information. I was inspired by games like barotrauma and duskers and how their use of limited information and information gathering guides player decision making.)_


Game Logic

The writing here should describe in plain, simple language the logic of the game:


Describe the logic involved in player decisions.
when first starting the player will have a few options open to them, a ping showing the distance and direction of objects around them, a directional ping giving them information on one object of their choosing, a move and a shoot.
Players will use these options to match one of the objects on the field to a given description before taking out said target(s).

Describe the logic that evaluates the player's victory/loss/progress status.
Players will have a limited number of turns to evaluate and eliminate their target
______________________________________________________________
The fewer turns they can complete their mission in the higher their “score”
______________________________________________________________
	Failure to eliminate the given target(s) in the allotted number of turns will result in 
______________________________________________________________
The player being given a fail state.

Adendum: Due to outside factors the timeline and resources the scope of this project was cut back significantly.

Adendum2: Was unable to solve the file issue resulting in many functions have to remain inside index.js
